    <p>This website describes <u>BlockGen</u>, a plugin developed for AutoCAD
      2012 to produce solid 3D blocks from data collected in archaeological
      contexts. AutoCAD cannot (at least until 2016) produce a 3D solid object
      given XYZ coordinates for each corner of the block; this plugin provides
      that functionality.</p>
    <p>The plugin was written for use in the analysis of the AP Palace at Tell
      Mozan, ancient Urkesh. The resulting publication, <a href="http://www.undena.com/BM.html#30"

        target="_blank">Three-dimensional Volumetric Analysis in an
        Archaeological Context</a>, was published in 2016 by <a href="http://www.undena.com/"

        target="_blank">Undena Press</a> within the Bibliotheca Mesopotamica
      series as an Open Access Monograph.</p>
    <p>The plugin design and requirements were written by <a href="http://www.federicobuccellati.net/"

        target="_blank">Federico Buccellati</a>, code was written by Steve
      Kimling of CADfx. The project is Open Source, published on the GitHub
      platform with versions saved on Zenodo. To cite project, please use DOI of
      the latest version on Zenodo: <a href="https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/133136534"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/133136534.svg" alt="DOI"></a>.</p>
