    <p>This website describes <u>BlockGen</u>, a plugin developed for AutoCAD
      2012 to produce solid 3D blocks from data collected in archaeological
      contexts. AutoCAD cannot (at least until 2016) produce a 3D solid object
      given XYZ coordinates for each corner of the block; this plugin provides
      that functionality.</p>
    <p>The plugin was written for use in the analysis of the AP Palace at Tell
      Mozan, ancient Urkesh. The resulting publication, <a href="http://www.undena.com/BM.html#30"

        target="_blank">Three-dimensional Volumetric Analysis in an
        Archaeological Context</a>, was published in 2016 by <a href="http://www.undena.com/"

        target="_blank">Undena Press</a> within the Bibliotheca Mesopotamica
      series as an Open Access Monograph.</p>
    <p>The plugin design and requirements were written by <a href="http://www.federicobuccellati.net/"

        target="_blank">Federico Buccellati</a>, code was written by Steve
      Kimling of <a href="https://www.cadfx.com/" target="_blank">CADfx</a>.
      The project is Open Source, published on the <a href="https://github.com/fabfab1/BlockGen"

        target="_blank">GitHub platform</a> with versions saved on Zenodo. To
